# libvalhalla

C++-to-Rust bindings for [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla) to access road graph tiles, powered by [cxx](http://cxx.rs).

## Crate structure

As it is impossible to forward cmake target information to cargo, this library isolates Valhalla's dependencies as well

- `libvalhalla-sys` - cmake target (C++ library) that hides Valhalla's types and nuances under a simple API
- `libvalhalla-cxxbridge` - autogenerated by `cxx` cargo target, glue between `libvalhalla` and `libvalhalla-sys`
- `libvalhalla` - cargo crate (Rust library) that forwards interface defined by `libvalhalla-sys` in a Rust manner
